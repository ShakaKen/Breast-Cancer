This repository contains an end-to-end data science project analyzing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project folder has various files, each a special emphasis on any of the following areas:

- **Data Ingestion**: Loading and inspecting raw data  
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**: Handling missing values and feature engineering  
- **EDA**: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and class imbalances  
- **Modeling**: Training multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Evaluation**: Comparing performance via accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices  
- **Interpretation**: Feature importance analysis and model explanations  
- **Deployment Preview**: Exporting the best model for future integration
